**Consider for:** Sprint 2 (dedicated focus on core shopping experience)

#### 🔄 US-008 to US-013: All other MVP features

**Reason:** Sprint 1 focused exclusively on foundation + authentication to establish solid base  
**Consider for:** Sprint 2 and Sprint 3 as planned in Product Backlog

## Risks & Mitigations

### Identified Risks

| Risk                                                                                 | Probability | Impact    | Mitigation Plan                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OAuth config complexity** (Google/Apple setup takes longer than expected)          | 🟡 Medium   | 🔴 High   | Allocate 2 extra hours buffer. Have Supabase docs ready. If blocked, use email/password as fallback temporarily. |
| **Supabase RLS policies confusion** (First time configuring, might take trial/error) | 🟡 Medium   | 🟡 Medium | Study RLS docs on Day 1. Have example policies ready. Test thoroughly with test users.                           |
| **Environment setup issues** (Version conflicts, OS-specific problems)               | 🟢 Low      | 🟡 Medium | Follow Architecture doc versions exactly. Use Docker if environment issues persist.                              |
| **First sprint velocity unknown** (May over/under-commit)                            | 🟡 Medium   | 🟡 Medium | Conservative commitment (60-70hrs max). Drop US-006 if running behind by Day 8.                                  |
| **Expo/React Native learning curve** (If first RN project)                           | 🟢 Low      | 🟡 Medium | Expo documentation is excellent. Community support strong. Allocate +2hrs for initial learning.                  |

### Blockers Anticipados

- [ ] **Google OAuth credentials approval delay** - Plan: Start OAuth setup on Day 1, not Day 4
- [ ] **Apple Developer account requirement** - Plan: Verify account access before sprint starts
- [ ] **Supabase project quota limits (free tier)** - Plan: Monitor usage, upgrade if needed (low cost)
- [ ] **GitHub Actions runner quota** - Plan: Use free tier wisely, optimize CI workflow

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture/Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] **Auth state management approach** - Resolve by: Day 2 (decide: Context API vs Zustand - recommend Zustand per Architecture)
- [ ] **Navigation structure final** - Resolve by: Day 1 (confirm 4 tabs vs 5 tabs)
- [ ] **Splash screen branding** - Resolve by: Day 3 (simple logo vs full branded screen - recommend simple for MVP)
- [ ] **Error handling strategy** - Resolve by: Day 2 (global error boundary vs per-feature handling)

### External Dependencies

- **Supabase Cloud:** Active and accessible ✅
- **Expo SDK:** Version ~49.0.0 confirmed stable ✅
- **Google Cloud Console:** Need to create OAuth credentials (Day 1 task)
- **Apple Developer Account:** Verify access for Sign-In with Apple setup
- **GitHub:** Repository and Actions ready ✅

### Development Environment Setup

**Before Sprint Starts (Pre-Sprint Checklist):**

- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Python 3.11.6 installed
- [ ] Expo CLI installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- [ ] iOS Simulator (Mac) or Android Emulator configured
- [ ] VS Code with React Native + Python extensions
- [ ] Git configured with GitHub account
- [ ] Supabase CLI installed (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Postman or similar for API testing

## Sprint Retrospective Preview

**Scheduled:** Friday, November 8, 2025 at 5:00 PM (after Review)  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Format:** Personal reflection (written doc)

**Topics to reflect:**

1. **What went well?**

   - Which stories were easier than expected?
   - What technical decisions paid off?
   - What should we keep doing?

2. **What didn't go well?**

   - Which stories were harder than expected?
   - What blockers slowed us down?
   - What should we stop doing?

3. **What should we improve for Sprint 2?**

   - Better estimation techniques?
   - Different task breakdown?
   - More research upfront?

4. **Velocity Established:**
   - Did we complete all 6 stories?
   - What is our baseline velocity? (use for Sprint 2 planning)
   - Was 60-70hrs realistic or should we adjust?

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Document velocity for Sprint 2 planning
- [ ] Update Architecture doc if tech decisions changed
- [ ] Add any technical debt to Product Backlog

---

## Commitment

**As the development team, I commit to:**

- [ ] Work on the stories selected in order of priority (US-001 → US-006)
- [ ] Do Daily Scrum every day at 9:00 AM (written update)
- [ ] Communicate blockers immediately (same day, not wait for next scrum)
- [ ] Not add scope without re-planning (no "while I'm here" features)
- [ ] Maintain DoD as minimum standard (no shortcuts)
- [ ] Prepare demo of completed work for Sprint Review
- [ ] Update Product Backlog velocity after Sprint 1 completion

**Sprint Goal Success Criteria:**

✅ **100% of committed stories (US-001 to US-006) completed with DoD**

Stretch: If we complete everything early, consider stretch goals. But priority #1 is quality delivery of committed work.

---

## Quick Reference

### 🚨 If New Urgent Work Arises:

1. **Evaluate vs Sprint Goal:** Does this help us achieve "Foundation + Auth + Navigation"?
2. **If CRITICAL (production down, security issue):** Handle immediately, then re-plan sprint
3. **If NOT CRITICAL:** Add to Product Backlog for Sprint 2, do NOT add to current sprint
4. **If in doubt:** Protect the Sprint Goal - say no to scope creep

### 📊 Check Sprint Health (Checkpoints):

- **Day 3 (Oct 30):** ✅ US-001 should be complete or nearly complete
- **Day 5 (Nov 1):** ✅ US-002 and US-003 should be done, US-004 started
- **Day 7 (Nov 5 - Mid-Sprint Check):** ✅ 50%+ of stories completed (US-001, 002, 003, and US-004 done)
- **Day 9 (Nov 7):** ✅ US-005 done, US-006 in progress
- **Day 10 (Nov 8):** ✅ All stories done, prep for Review

### ⚠️ Red Flags:

- **Story with no progress for 2+ days** → Reassess complexity or approach
- **Blocker not resolved in 24 hours** → Escalate or find workaround
- **Doubt about AC of a story** → Clarify immediately, don't guess
- **By Day 7, less than 40% complete** → Consider dropping US-006 to protect Sprint Goal

### 🎯 Daily Priority Check:

**Every morning ask:**

1. What's the next highest priority story not yet done?
2. Are there any dependencies blocking me?
3. Do I understand all ACs for what I'm working on today?

## Sprint 1 Success Mindset

**Remember:**

✨ **This is Sprint 1** - We're establishing baseline velocity and learning our rhythm  
✨ **Foundation matters** - Quality setup saves hours in future sprints  
✨ **It's okay to drop stories** - Better to deliver 5 stories with quality than 6 stories rushed  
✨ **Document as you go** - Future you will thank present you for good docs  
✨ **Celebrate wins** - First sprint completion is a major milestone!

**Sprint 1 Mantra:** _"Solid foundation, quality first, establish velocity."_

## Appendix: Story Dependency Graph

```
US-001 (Project Setup)
  ├── US-002 (Database Schema)
  │     └── US-004 (Social Login)
  │           └── US-005 (Onboarding)
  │                 └── US-006 (Navigation)
  └── US-003 (Splash Screen)
```

**Critical Path:** US-001 → US-002 → US-004 → US-005 → US-006  
**Can parallelize:** US-003 can start as soon as US-001 is done
